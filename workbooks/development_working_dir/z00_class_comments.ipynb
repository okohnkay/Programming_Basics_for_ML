    "The short answer is: as much as you can. Having more of an explanation for your code is very rarely a bad thing, though the importance varies. If you are writing code that is only going to be used by you, then you can probably get away with less commenting. If you're working on larger projects with others, or especially if you are writing things that may be used or distributed to others, then you should really try to provide a full, coherent, and detailed explanation of what your code does in the docstring and comments. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the immediate future, you're probably going to be writing things that are pretty limited in scope and that few other people will ever touch, so commenting may feel extra annoying and useless. However, it's a good habit to get into, and it will make your life easier when you do start working on larger projects."
