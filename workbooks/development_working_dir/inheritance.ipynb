    "\n",
    "In Python, inheritance works by passing the parent class as an argument to the definition of a child class. The child class will inherit all of the attributes and methods of the parent class, and can be used in the same way as the parent class. \n",

    "### Overriding Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance allows us to override methods of the parent class. This is useful when we want to change the behavior of a method in the child class. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overriding a method is as simple as defining a method with the same name in the child class. This is very useful as it allows us to redefine methods so they make sense given the context of our object - such as how adding two strings with a `+` operator concatenates them, but adding two integers with a `+` operator adds them together. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overriding methods can also help to make it easier to build reusable code. We can define a method in the parent class that defines some action, then each child class can implement that action in a way that makes sense for that class. For example, if we think of the context of a grocery store and the items in it. There may be an \"item\" class that defines some basic attributes and methods that all items have, such as a name, price, and a method to calculate the tax on the item. Then, we can define a \"produce\" class that inherits from the \"item\" class, and overrides the tax calculation method to return 0, since produce is not taxed. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> \"ingredients\" in Canada aren't taxed - things like vegtables, meat, etc. Other products, like soap, or ready to eat meals, are taxed. "
