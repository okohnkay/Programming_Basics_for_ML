    "# Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most powerful aspects of object-oriented programming is how it allows for the reuse of code. Inheritance is a key feature of object-oriented programming that allows a class to inherit the behavior of another class, extending its abilities or creating a subtype of it. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Inherited Relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "When we use inheritance, we say that there is an \"is-a relationship\", or that the child class is a subtype of the parent class. This means that the subclass (or child class) inherits all of the attributes and behaviors of the superclass (or parent class). The subclass is everything that its parent is, plus whatever unique features it has.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the child class can be used as the parent - it has all the same attributes and methods, and we can plug in a child class object anywhere we would use a parent class object. The opposite is not true - we cannot use a parent class object where a child class object is expected, because the parent class object does not have all of the attributes and methods of the child class. For example:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> A `Dog` class might inherit from a `Mammal` class, which might inherit from an `Animal` class. </li>\n",
    "<li> A `Dog` is a `Mammal`, and a `Mammal` is an `Animal`.</li> \n",
    "<li> But an `Animal` is not necessarily a `Mammal`, and a `Mammal` is not necessarily a `Dog`.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "So a dog can blink(), because that is something all animals can do, and they can give_berth(), because that is something all mammals can do. An Animal object can't wag_your_tail() as that is a dog thing, not an animal thing. "

    "### Inheriting from a Class\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, inheritance works by passing the parent class as an argument to the definition of a child class. The child class will inherit all of the attributes and methods of the parent class, and can be used in the same way as the parent class. \n",

    "### Variable Scoping\n",
    "\n",
    "When using attributes inside of classes that we are using for inheritance we need to pay special attention to the scope of each variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "In inheritance this is especially important because we can likely expect a bit of redundancy between the parent and child classes. Variables that are declared with a single underscore in the parent as \"protected\" are a special class of variable that are available to the class itself as well as children, but is limited from being accessible anywhere else."

    "### Overriding Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance allows us to override methods of the parent class. This is useful when we want to change the behavior of a method in the child class. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overriding a method is as simple as defining a method with the same name in the child class. This is very useful as it allows us to redefine methods so they make sense given the context of our object - such as how adding two strings with a `+` operator concatenates them, but adding two integers with a `+` operator adds them together. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overriding methods can also help to make it easier to build reusable code. We can define a method in the parent class that defines some action, then each child class can implement that action in a way that makes sense for that class. For example, if we think of the context of a grocery store and the items in it. There may be an \"item\" class that defines some basic attributes and methods that all items have, such as a name, price, and a method to calculate the tax on the item. Then, we can define a \"produce\" class that inherits from the \"item\" class, and overrides the tax calculation method to return 0, since produce is not taxed. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> \"ingredients\" in Canada aren't taxed - things like vegetables, meat, etc. Other products, like soap, or ready to eat meals, are taxed. "

Functionality such as the `__str__` method, which returns a string representation of the object, or the `__eq__` method, which checks if two objects are equal - things you'll note that we want to override if we want things to be useful, but which work for all objects. When we don't override these, we are getting the \"stock\" version. "
